--- PROJECT QUESTION STARTED -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Q1 List all successful orders that were made in Taiwan
--- Expected answer: Select * for results to display all fields in the original table and sort by highest to lowest gmv_local

select * from orders 
WHERE is_successful_order 
like '%TRUE%'
AND country_name = 'Taiwan'
order by gmv_local desc
;

--- Q2 Find the Total GMV by country
--- Expected answer: Display only Country and Total GMV, sort by GMV

select country_name as Country, gmv_local as Total_GMV
from orders
group by country_name
order by gmv_local
;

--- Q3 Find the top active vendor by GMV in each country
--- Expected answer: Display only country, vendor name and total GMV, sort by country first then vendor GMV

select orders.country_name as Country, vendors.vendor_name as Vendor, orders.gmv_local as GMV
from orders
left join vendors 
on orders.vendor_id = vendors.id

order by  Country, GMV;

--- Q4 Find the top 2 vendors per country, in each year available in the dataset
--- Expected answer: Display only 2 vendors per country, year, country, and total GMV, sorted by country, then vendor GMV
